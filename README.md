# SortingVisualizer

## Motivation
There are a lot of videos about Sorting Visualizer on YouTube, and I think it is really cool; hence, I started this project. This project is quite easy but still giving me a chance to review some classic sorting algorithms.

## Dependencies
For this project, I use OpenGL to make algorithms visualizable.

## Algorithm
I have done 7 sorting algorithm and will add more later.
